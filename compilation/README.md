# Compilation

Processes source code to convert it to Assembly that the Assembler can
understand.

If dealing with GCC, then using the command below directly on the source code or
on the preprocessed code yields the same `.s` file.

## Commands

-	Compilation

	```shell
	$ gcc -S hello-world.c
	```

## Sample Output

[hello-world.s](hello-world.s)
